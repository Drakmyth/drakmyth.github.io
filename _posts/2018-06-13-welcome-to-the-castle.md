Hello! Welcome! Make yourself at home!

It's been a long time since I've had a blog. I wasn't good at it back then, hopefully I'll be a little better at it now.

In my day to day as a software engineer, I'm finding that more and more often I'm running into the scenario where I'm trying to set something up, and the instructions to do so are confusing, incomplete, or just plain wrong. It's infuriating!

I decided that rather than continuing to scour the internet, pulling together bits and pieces from blogs, mailing lists, and [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] to get something working, then promptly forgetting all that information once it was up and running, that I should create that which I wish had existed; a single, complete, and correct write up of how to do what should be simple but for some reason is not. That is the primary type content that you'll find here.

I'll probably also be posting various thoughts and ramblings from time to time and I hope you'll forgive me for that. Those may range from opinions and frustrations to simple updates about my weekend plans.

Hope you all are having a wonderful day!

~ S
