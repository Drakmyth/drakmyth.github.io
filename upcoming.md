Here's the list of topics I intend to write blog posts about when I get the time and feel I've explored the subject sufficiently enough to explain it.

* Syntax highlighting with Rouge - [Reference][ref3] - [Reference][ref4]
* RESTful API Guidelines and Best Practices
* AWS CloudWatch + Elasticsearch via Lambda
* Migrating from Font Awesome v4 to v5
* Using Font Awesome Without Tags - [Reference][ref1]
* Neural Networks in F# - [Reference][ref2]
* Website scraping in F#
* Setting up comments on GitHub Pages with Staticman
* Jekyll and GitHub Pages
